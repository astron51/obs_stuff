# Speech-To-Text-To-Speech
I am curious how Zentreya from VShojo able to synthesize her voice into TTS, so after spending some time with Google API, I created this application. It use Google's Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech API to mimic how Zentreya talk. It will also output a Text File which You can use to display in OBS or other Streaming Application.
