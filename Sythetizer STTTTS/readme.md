# Speech-To-Text-To-Speech
I am curious how Zentreya from VShojo able to synthesize her voice into TTS, so after spending some time with Google API, I created this application. It use Google's Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech API to mimic how Zentreya talk. It will also output a Text File which You can use to display in OBS or other Streaming Application.
Please raise Issue if there are any bugs. Made with love from astron51

# Where's the damn source!
Well, It's a mess and I planned to rework it with a user interface in the future. But if you really wanna get your hand on the source code, just open an issue and ask for it, It's free anyway.
